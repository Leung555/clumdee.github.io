## Hello there :)

Thank you for dropping by. As you stumbled upon this site, I presume we are like-minded who enjoy learning and improving oneself. I hope the contents provided here could be useful to you.

On this page I blog [articles]({{ site.url }}/blog) that reflect thoughts at certain stages of life such as graduation and experiencing new culture. I also write about [projects in data science]({{ site.url }}/codes) describing motivations, fundamental concepts, and logic behind. The projects range from [data analysis]({{ site.url }}/blog/thailand-wages-by-occupation_full-code), [blockchain]({{ site.url }}/blog/blockchain-DIY-with-python), and [recommender systems]({{ site.url }}/blog/recommender-system-with-python). The articles are available only either in English or in Thai (at the moment), but the codes were commented and annotated in English. If you are also interested in nanoscience, then you can check out some of my [talks]({{ site.url }}/talks) in the topic of nanophotonics.

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. I am eagerly looking forward to learning many new things from you.

Let the fun begin ~
